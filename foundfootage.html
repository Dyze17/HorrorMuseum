    <h2>What is Found Footage Horror?</h2>
    <p>Found footage is a subgenre of horror filmmaking in which all or a substantial part of the work is presented as if it were discovered film or video recordings. The narrative is typically conveyed through the lens of cameras operated by the characters themselves, often implying that the footage is the last remaining record of the events, left behind by missing or deceased protagonists. This technique aims to create a strong sense of realism, immediacy, and immersion, blurring the lines between fiction and reality for the audience.</p>
    <p>Key characteristics of found footage films often include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>First-Person Perspective:</strong> The audience experiences events through the characters' cameras, enhancing immersion.</li>
      <li><strong>Realism/Authenticity:</strong> Employs shaky camera work, naturalistic acting, amateurish framing, and often an absence of a traditional musical score to mimic real home videos or documentaries.</li>
      <li><strong>Diegetic Camerawork:</strong> The camera is part of the story world, operated by characters within the narrative.</li>
      <li><strong>Limited Perspective:</strong> Information is often restricted to what the characters see and record, heightening suspense and mystery.</li>
      <li><strong>Themes of Surveillance and Voyeurism:</strong> The act of recording and watching often becomes a thematic element.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Evolution Through the Decades</h2>
    <p><strong>Early Origins (Pre-1990s):</strong> While not a fully formed genre, elements of the "found document" or mock-documentary style appeared earlier. The controversial film "Cannibal Holocaust" (1980) is often cited as a significant early example and a progenitor of the modern found footage horror film due to its presentation of "recovered" film reels.</p>
    <p><strong>The Rise to Prominence (Late 1990s - 2000s):</strong> "The Blair Witch Project" (1999) was a landmark film that popularized the found footage technique for horror. Its innovative viral marketing campaign further blurred the lines between fiction and reality, contributing to its massive success. This sparked a renewed interest in the subgenre. The 2000s saw a boom, with films like "Paranormal Activity" (2007) demonstrating the profitability and effectiveness of the style, leading to numerous sequels and imitators. "[REC]" (2007) and "Cloverfield" (2008) also gained international acclaim during this period.</p>
    <p><strong>Technological Advancements and Diversification (2010s - Present):</strong> As personal recording technology became more ubiquitous (smartphones, webcams, GoPros), the genre adapted, incorporating these new media forms. While some argue the market became oversaturated, filmmakers continued to find creative ways to use the technique. Horror anthologies like "V/H/S" (2012) explored different facets of found footage, and films began to experiment with different digital interfaces like Skype calls or computer screens (e.g., "Unfriended," "Host"). The genre also expanded beyond pure horror into sci-fi and action.</p>

          <h3>The Blair Witch Project (1999)</h3>
          <p>Directors: Daniel Myrick & Eduardo Sánchez</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Curator's Note:</strong> This film revolutionized horror marketing with its pioneering use of the internet to build a mythos suggesting the footage was real. Made on a shoestring budget, its raw, unsettling atmosphere and unseen terrors proved that what you *don't* see can be far scarier.

          <h3>Paranormal Activity (2007)</h3>
          <p>Director: Oren Peli</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Curator's Note:</strong> Another micro-budget sensation, this film used a simple premise and static camera shots to build incredible tension and scares, largely taking place in a single bedroom. It demonstrated that effective horror doesn't always need a big budget, just a good understanding of suspense.

          <h3>[REC] (2007)</h3>
          <p>Directors: Jaume Balagueró & Paco Plaza</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Curator's Note:</strong> This Spanish film offers a visceral and claustrophobic experience, trapping a reporter and her cameraman inside a quarantined apartment building with a terrifying infection. Its intensity and relentless pace made it an international found footage hit, spawning several sequels and an American remake ("Quarantine").

          <h3>Cloverfield (2008)</h3>
          <p>Director: Matt Reeves</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Curator's Note:</strong> "Cloverfield" brought the found footage style to a giant monster movie, offering a unique ground-level perspective of a city under siege. Its viral marketing campaign, similar to "The Blair Witch Project," built massive anticipation by keeping the monster's appearance a secret until release.

    <h2>Found Footage Horror's Influence</h2>
    <p>Found footage horror has made a significant impact due to its ability to create a unique sense of dread and verisimilitude, often on a low budget. It taps into primal fears of witnessing something forbidden or real. The style forces audiences to engage actively, piecing together events from a limited, subjective viewpoint. While sometimes criticized for an overreliance on shaky cam or predictable scares, the genre's most effective entries are praised for their ingenuity and immersive horror. Its influence extends beyond horror, with the technique being adopted in other genres to enhance realism or provide a unique narrative perspective. The evolution of the genre reflects changes in media consumption and technology, making it a continually adapting form of storytelling.</p>
