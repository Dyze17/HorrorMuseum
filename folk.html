    <h2>What is Folk Horror?</h2>
    <p>Folk horror is a subgenre of horror that draws upon folklore, pastoral settings, and ancient traditions to evoke fear and unease. It often depicts isolated rural communities where old customs, pagan beliefs, and folk religions clash with the modern world, leading to unsettling and terrifying outcomes. The horror in these narratives frequently stems from the skewed belief systems of "the folk" and the dark aspects of nature or forgotten rituals.</p>
    <p>Key elements often found in folk horror include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rural and Isolated Settings:</strong> The landscape itself often plays a crucial role, isolating communities and individuals.</li>
      <li><strong>Folklore and Ancient Beliefs:</strong> Themes of superstition, paganism, witchcraft, and old rituals are central.</li>
      <li><strong>Clash of Cultures/Beliefs:</strong> Often features an outsider or modern sensibilities encountering and conflicting with deeply entrenched, ancient, or disturbing local customs.</li>
      <li><strong>Community as a Threat:</strong> Isolated communities with their own insular traditions and "skewed belief systems" can become the source of horror.</li>
      <li><strong>Ritual and Sacrifice:</strong> Human or animal sacrifice as part of ancient rites is a recurring theme.</li>
      <li><strong>Atmospheric Dread:</strong> Relies more on building a sense of unease, foreboding, and psychological horror than on jump scares or overt gore.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Evolution and History</h2>
    <p><strong>Literary Roots and Early Influences:</strong> The roots of folk horror can be traced to Gothic literature and earlier folk tales that explored the unsettling aspects of the rural and the ancient. Writers who explored pagan survivals and weird fiction influenced the thematic concerns of the genre.</p>
    <p><strong>The "Unholy Trinity" (Late 1960s - Early 1970s):</strong> The term "folk horror" gained prominence in film discourse largely through a group of British films from this era. Often cited as the "Unholy Trinity" by Adam Scovell, these films are Michael Reeves' "Witchfinder General" (1968), Piers Haggard's "The Blood on Satan's Claw" (1971), and Robin Hardy's "The Wicker Man" (1973). These films established many of the core thematic and aesthetic concerns of cinematic folk horror, particularly the emphasis on landscape and isolated communities.</p>
    <p><strong>Intervening Years and Global Interpretations:</strong> While the initial wave was predominantly British, folk horror elements appeared in films from other countries, drawing on their own local folklore and traditions. The genre didn't disappear but was perhaps less distinctly defined for a period.</p>
    <p><strong>Modern Revival (2010s - Present):</strong> The 21st century has seen a significant resurgence and re-evaluation of folk horror. Films like Robert Eggers' "The Witch" (2015) and Ari Aster's "Midsommar" (2019) have brought the subgenre to new audiences, often with a focus on meticulous historical detail or "elevated horror" sensibilities that blend psychological depth with folk horror tropes. This revival has also spurred more academic and critical interest in defining and exploring the subgenre. Contemporary folk horror often carries social commentary, reflecting modern anxieties through ancient fears.</p>

          <h3>Witchfinder General (1968)</h3>
          <p>Director: Michael Reeves</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Curator's Note:</strong> Part of the "Unholy Trinity" of folk horror, this brutal film depicts the real-life horrors of Matthew Hopkins, a 17th-century witch hunter. Its grim realism and Vincent Price's chilling performance offer a dark look at fanaticism and the English countryside's unsettling past. Tragically, it was director Michael Reeves' final film.

          <h3>The Wicker Man (1973)</h3>
          <p>Director: Robin Hardy</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Curator's Note:</strong> This cult classic is renowned for its unsettling atmosphere, folk music, and shocking climax. It cleverly subverts expectations, presenting its pagan community not as overtly monstrous but as disturbingly normal in their ancient beliefs. Christopher Lee considered his role as Lord Summerisle one of his best.

          <h3>The Witch (2015)</h3>
          <p>Director: Robert Eggers</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Curator's Note:</strong> Subtitled "A New-England Folktale," this film is celebrated for its period accuracy in language and setting, creating a deeply immersive and unsettling experience. It explores themes of religious paranoia, family breakdown, and the terrifying power of the unknown lurking in the primeval forest. The goat, Black Phillip, became an unlikely horror icon!

          <h3>Midsommar (2019)</h3>
          <p>Director: Ari Aster</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Curator's Note:</strong> A unique "daylight horror" film, "Midsommar" unsettlingly juxtaposes bright, beautiful Swedish folk traditions with disturbing pagan rituals and psychological breakdown. It's a vivid exploration of grief, codependency, and the allure of belonging, even within a sinister community. The intricate details in the Hårga's art and customs are fascinating.

    <h2>Folk Horror's Influence</h2>
    <p>Folk horror's influence lies in its ability to tap into primal fears related to the land, ancient beliefs, and the unsettling nature of isolated communities. It explores the darkness that can lurk beneath idyllic pastoral surfaces and the terrifying power of collective belief. The genre often challenges notions of modernity versus tradition and civilization versus the "primitive." Its emphasis on atmosphere, psychological dread, and unsettling ambiguity has influenced a new generation of horror filmmakers. As societies grapple with their relationship to history, nature, and cultural identity, folk horror continues to provide a potent lens through which to explore these anxieties.</p>
