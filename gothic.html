        <h2>What is Gothic Horror?</h2>
        <p>Gothic horror emerged in the late 18th century as a literary genre that combined elements of horror and romance. It is characterized by its dark, mysterious, and supernatural elements, often set in gloomy, decaying locations like castles, mansions, and ruins. The genre explores themes of death, decay, madness, secrets, and forbidden desires, creating an atmosphere of dread and suspense.</p>

        <p>In cinema, Gothic horror began with the Universal monster movies of the 1930s, such as "Dracula" and "Frankenstein," which established many of the visual and thematic elements that would define the genre. Gothic horror films often feature:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Atmospheric and moody cinematography with heavy shadows</li>
            <li>Crumbling castles, ancient mansions, and decaying estates</li>
            <li>Supernatural or monstrous antagonists</li>
            <li>Themes of aristocracy, legacy, and family curses</li>
            <li>Psychological torment and forbidden love</li>
            <li>Religious symbolism and moral conflicts</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Evolution Through the Decades</h2>
        <p><strong>1930s-1940s:</strong> The foundation of Gothic horror in cinema was established by Universal Studios with their classic monster films. Bela Lugosi's portrayal of Count Dracula and Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's monster defined the visual language of the genre. These films embraced German Expressionist techniques with dramatic lighting, shadows, and theatrical performances.</p>

        <p><strong>1950s-1960s:</strong> Hammer Film Productions revitalized Gothic horror with vibrant color films starring Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. These British productions embraced a more explicit approach with vivid blood, heightened sexuality, and dramatic performances. Films like "Horror of Dracula" (1958) and "The Curse of Frankenstein" (1957) brought a new intensity to the genre.</p>

        <p><strong>1970s-1980s:</strong> Directors like Roger Corman adapted Edgar Allan Poe's stories with psychological depth and visual style. Meanwhile, films like "The Innocents" (1961) and "The Haunting" (1963) emphasized psychological horror over explicit violence. This period also saw Italian Gothic horror from directors like Mario Bava, who combined atmospheric style with more graphic content.</p>

        <p><strong>1990s-2000s:</strong> Gothic horror continued with films like Francis Ford Coppola's "Bram Stoker's Dracula" (1992) and Kenneth Branagh's "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" (1994), which emphasized literary fidelity and romantic themes. Tim Burton's stylized gothic aesthetic in films like "Sleepy Hollow" (1999) brought a modern sensibility to classic gothic elements.</p>

        <p><strong>2010s-Present:</strong> Modern Gothic horror has embraced psychological complexity and social commentary. Films like Guillermo del Toro's "Crimson Peak" (2015) and Robert Eggers' "The Lighthouse" (2019) honor traditional Gothic elements while exploring deeper themes and innovative visual styles. Gothic horror has also expanded into television with series like "Penny Dreadful" and "The Haunting of Hill House."</p>

                    <h3>Dracula (1931)</h3>
                    <p>Director: Tod Browning</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Curator's Note:</strong> Bela Lugosi's portrayal of the suave, aristocratic vampire became legendary. Interestingly, Lugosi learned many of his lines phonetically as his English was still limited at the time, yet his performance defined the character for generations. The film's use of silence and shadow masterfully builds its eerie atmosphere.

                    <h3>Frankenstein (1931)</h3>
                    <p>Director: James Whale</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Curator's Note:</strong> Boris Karloff's sympathetic yet terrifying portrayal of the Monster, famously achieved with groundbreaking makeup by Jack Pierce, is a cornerstone of horror. A little-known fact: the iconic flat head wasn't in Mary Shelley's novel but was an invention for the film to suggest where the brain was implanted.

                <h3>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920)</h3>
                <p>Director: Robert Wiene</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Curator's Note:</strong> A masterpiece of German Expressionism, this film's distorted, dreamlike sets and painted shadows visually represent the narrator's fractured psyche. Its visual style was revolutionary and profoundly influenced the look of many future horror and film noir productions. It's a true "must-see" for understanding early horror's artistic ambitions.

                <h3>Rebecca (1940)</h3>
                <p>Director: Alfred Hitchcock</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Curator's Note:</strong> While often categorized as a psychological thriller, Hitchcock's first American film is steeped in Gothic romance and horror. The imposing Manderley estate acts as a character itself, haunted by the memory of the unseen Rebecca. Fun fact: The film won Best Picture, a rare feat for a movie with such strong horror undertones.
