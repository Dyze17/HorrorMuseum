    <p class="narrative-intro">
      Following a decade of remakes and extreme horror, the 2010s witnessed a significant shift often dubbed the "horror renaissance" or the rise of "elevated" or "art-house" horror. Independent filmmakers gained prominence, crafting films that blended psychological depth, social commentary, and often arthouse aesthetics with traditional horror tropes, earning critical acclaim and captivating new audiences.
    </p>

    <h1>Elevated Themes, Indie Spirit, and Social Commentary</h1>
    <p>The 2010s saw horror evolve with a new wave of intelligent, thought-provoking films. These often combined profound psychological depth and potent social commentary with supernatural or visceral terror. Movies like "Get Out" and "Hereditary" pushed the genre beyond simple scares, exploring themes of trauma, identity, grief, and systemic societal fears, all while delivering unsettling and memorable horror experiences. The indie scene thrived, producing unique and often minimalist horror that resonated strongly and demonstrated the genre's continued artistic evolution.</p>

    <h2>It Follows (2014)</h2>
    <p>David Robert Mitchell's "It Follows" is a minimalist yet terrifying film that introduced a relentless, slow-walking supernatural entity passed through sexual contact. Its dreamlike atmosphere, eerie cinematography by Mike Gioulakis, and an iconic synth score by Disasterpeace created a constant sense of dread. It redefined supernatural horror with its unique premise and slow-burning tension, becoming an indie sensation and a prime example of how horror could evolve classic stalking tropes into allegories for modern anxieties.</p>

    <h2>The Witch (2015)</h2>
    <p>Robert Eggers' "The Witch," subtitled "A New-England Folktale," is a meticulously crafted slow-burn folk horror set in the 1600s. It follows a Puritan family exiled to the wilderness, where paranoia, religious extremism, and an unseen evil drive them to madness. Its haunting cinematography, period-accurate dialogue, and psychological dread masterfully explore themes of isolation, faith, and the fear of the unknown, signaling a major resurgence and evolution of the folk horror subgenre.</p>

    <h2>Get Out (2017)</h2>
    <p>Jordan Peele’s directorial debut was a cultural landmark, seamlessly blending sharp racial commentary and biting social satire with genuinely terrifying psychological horror. The film follows a Black man visiting his white girlfriend’s seemingly liberal family, only to uncover a sinister, unimaginable secret. "Get Out" redefined modern horror by proving it could be a powerful vehicle for discussing complex social issues, earning critical acclaim and an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and paving the way for more socially conscious horror.</p>

    <h2>Hereditary (2018)</h2>
    <p>Ari Aster's "Hereditary" is a deeply disturbing family horror film that masterfully explores grief, inherited trauma, and escalating supernatural terror. Following a family unraveling dark secrets after their secretive grandmother’s death, the film builds unbearable tension through its unsettling imagery, shocking narrative turns, and an unforgettable, raw performance by Toni Collette. It cemented the rise of "elevated horror" focused on emotional and psychological devastation as much as scares, showing a new evolution in how horror could explore the darkest corners of family life.</p>

    <p class="narrative-conclusion">
      The 2010s marked a significant evolution, with horror gaining new critical respect through films that were as thematically rich as they were terrifying.
