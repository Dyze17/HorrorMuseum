    <h2>What is Slasher Horror?</h2>
    <p>Slasher horror is a subgenre of horror films characterized by a relentless, often masked or disfigured antagonist who stalks and murders a group of people, typically teenagers or young adults, usually with bladed or sharp tools. These films are known for their high body count, suspenseful stalking sequences, graphic violence, and the common trope of the "Final Girl."</p>
    <p>Key characteristics of slasher films often include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Killer:</strong> A central, often iconic antagonist, who may have a specific motivation like revenge and uses a signature weapon (e.g., knives, machetes).</li>
      <li><strong>The Victims:</strong> Typically a group of young people, often picked off one by one.</li>
      <li><strong>The Final Girl:</strong> A resourceful female protagonist who often survives to confront the killer.</li>
      <li><strong>Weaponry:</strong> Non-firearm weapons are prevalent, with common objects turned into instruments of terror.</li>
      <li><strong>Setting:</strong> Isolated locations like summer camps, small towns, or abandoned houses are common settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Suspense and Gore:</strong> Heavy reliance on building suspense, jump scares, and graphic depictions of violence.</li>
      <li><strong>Themes:</strong> Common themes include revenge, past trauma, and often a sense of moral judgment where characters engaging in perceived "immoral" behavior are targeted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Evolution Through the Decades</h2>
    <p><strong>Early Influences (Pre-1970s):</strong> While films like Michael Powell's "Peeping Tom" (1960) and Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho" (1960) are considered significant early influences or proto-slashers, along with Italian Giallo films, the slasher formula wasn't fully codified until later.</p>
    <p><strong>The Golden Age (Late 1970s - Mid 1980s):</strong> This period is considered the "Golden Age" of slasher films. John Carpenter's "Halloween" (1978) is widely credited with popularizing the genre and setting many of its conventions. This was followed by a boom of films like "Friday the 13th" (1980) and "A Nightmare on Elm Street" (1984), which introduced iconic killers and emphasized practical effects and gore.</p>
    <p><strong>Late 1980s - Early 1990s:</strong> The genre saw a decline in popularity with numerous sequels and imitations leading to market saturation. However, some films like "Child's Play" (1988) and "Candyman" (1992) offered variations on the formula.</p>
    <p><strong>Mid-Late 1990s (Revival):</strong> Wes Craven's "Scream" (1996) revitalized the genre with its meta-commentary and self-awareness, deconstructing slasher tropes while delivering effective scares. This led to a new wave of teen-focused slashers.</p>
    <p><strong>2000s - Present:</strong> The 2000s saw a mix of remakes of classic slashers, and films that leaned into more extreme violence. In recent years, there's been a continued evolution with films that blend slasher elements with other subgenres or offer fresh social commentary, alongside throwbacks to the classic era. The genre also reflects cultural shifts, for instance, incorporating elements of social media.</p>

          <h3>Halloween (1978)</h3>
          <p>Director: John Carpenter</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Curator's Note:</strong> Often credited with popularizing the slasher subgenre, "Halloween" introduced the chillingly implacable Michael Myers. A fun fact: the iconic Myers mask was a modified Captain Kirk (William Shatner) mask painted white, chosen for its eerily blank expression and costing only $1.98!

          <h3>Friday the 13th (1980)</h3>
          <p>Director: Sean S. Cunningham</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Curator's Note:</strong> This film capitalized on the success of "Halloween" and became a massive franchise. While Jason Voorhees is the series icon, spoiler alert for newcomers: he's not the killer in this first film! The movie's effective use of practical gore effects by Tom Savini set a new bar for the genre.

          <h3>A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)</h3>
          <p>Director: Wes Craven</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Curator's Note:</strong> Wes Craven ingeniously blended the slasher formula with surreal, dream-based horror, creating Freddy Krueger – a villain who could kill you in your sleep. The concept was inspired by real-life accounts of people dying in their sleep after experiencing terrifying nightmares.

          <h3>Scream (1996)</h3>
          <p>Director: Wes Craven</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Curator's Note:</strong> "Scream" revitalized the slasher genre in the 90s with its witty, self-referential humor and genuine scares. The characters famously discussed the "rules" of surviving a horror movie, even as they were living one. The Ghostface mask was an off-the-shelf Halloween costume find, not originally designed for the film!
