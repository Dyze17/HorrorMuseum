    <h2>What is Slasher Horror?</h2>
    <p>Slasher horror is a subgenre of horror films characterized by a relentless, often masked or disfigured antagonist who stalks and murders a group of people, typically teenagers or young adults, usually with bladed or sharp tools. These films are known for their high body count, suspenseful stalking sequences, graphic violence, and the common trope of the "Final Girl."</p>
    <p>Key characteristics of slasher films often include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Killer:</strong> A central, often iconic antagonist, who may have a specific motivation like revenge and uses a signature weapon (e.g., knives, machetes).</li>
      <li><strong>The Victims:</strong> Typically a group of young people, often picked off one by one.</li>
      <li><strong>The Final Girl:</strong> A resourceful female protagonist who often survives to confront the killer.</li>
      <li><strong>Weaponry:</strong> Non-firearm weapons are prevalent, with common objects turned into instruments of terror.</li>
      <li><strong>Setting:</strong> Isolated locations like summer camps, small towns, or abandoned houses are common settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Suspense and Gore:</strong> Heavy reliance on building suspense, jump scares, and graphic depictions of violence.</li>
      <li><strong>Themes:</strong> Common themes include revenge, past trauma, and often a sense of moral judgment where characters engaging in perceived "immoral" behavior are targeted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Evolution Through the Decades</h2>
    <p><strong>Early Influences (Pre-1970s):</strong> While films like Michael Powell's "Peeping Tom" (1960) and Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho" (1960) are considered significant early influences or proto-slashers, along with Italian Giallo films, the slasher formula wasn't fully codified until later.</p>
    <p><strong>The Golden Age (Late 1970s - Mid 1980s):</strong> This period is considered the "Golden Age" of slasher films. John Carpenter's "Halloween" (1978) is widely credited with popularizing the genre and setting many of its conventions. This was followed by a boom of films like "Friday the 13th" (1980) and "A Nightmare on Elm Street" (1984), which introduced iconic killers and emphasized practical effects and gore.</p>
    <p><strong>Late 1980s - Early 1990s:</strong> The genre saw a decline in popularity with numerous sequels and imitations leading to market saturation. However, some films like "Child's Play" (1988) and "Candyman" (1992) offered variations on the formula.</p>
    <p><strong>Mid-Late 1990s (Revival):</strong> Wes Craven's "Scream" (1996) revitalized the genre with its meta-commentary and self-awareness, deconstructing slasher tropes while delivering effective scares. This led to a new wave of teen-focused slashers.</p>
    <p><strong>2000s - Present:</strong> The 2000s saw a mix of remakes of classic slashers, and films that leaned into more extreme violence. In recent years, there's been a continued evolution with films that blend slasher elements with other subgenres or offer fresh social commentary, alongside throwbacks to the classic era. The genre also reflects cultural shifts, for instance, incorporating elements of social media.</p>

    <h2>Slasher Horror's Influence</h2>
    <p>Slasher films have had a significant impact on popular culture, creating some of horror's most recognizable villains and establishing tropes that are still referenced and subverted today. The genre often explores themes of survival, trauma, and the consequences of past actions, resonating with audiences through its suspenseful narratives and memorable antagonists. While sometimes criticized for its violence, particularly against women, the genre has also been noted for its strong "Final Girl" characters and its ability to reflect societal anxieties. More recent slashers have sometimes adopted feminist perspectives, showing the genre's capacity to evolve.</p>
